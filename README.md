# 🛍️ bookstore-react

Modern rebuild of a college group bookstore project using the **MERN stack** and a **monorepo architecture**.

This full-stack web app showcases clean React UI, RESTful backend APIs, and scalable monorepo setup.  
Built with **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS** on the frontend and **Express + MongoDB** on the backend.

---


## 🎯 Goals

* Migrate legacy MEAN codebase to modern MERN
* Apply full-stack best practices using monorepo
* Emphasize maintainability, modular design, and developer tooling
* Showcase full dev pipeline from design to deployment

## 🧠 Reflections
This version demonstrates my ability to:

Independently rebuild a full-stack project using modern tools

Migrate UI logic and design to React + Tailwind with good structure and accessibility

Prioritize features to balance scope vs timeline

Plan for future scalability by choosing Firebase + tokens for flexible, secure auth
